    <h2>College</h2>
    
    <p id="College">
        <img id="Cole" src="Cole.jpg"> My name is Cole and I'm currently taking CSC106 as the first class to fulfilling my Computer Science major. I have learn't
         some HTML and CSS before in Highschool so I hope that this class will help deepen my understanding about the language
        and help me get into the coding mindset for further classes. I have a lot of classes that I need to take to fulfill my major so I
        will most likely be taking courses over the summer to graduate in 3 years and possible go for a Masters.

    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p><img id="Volleyball" src="unnamed.jpg">I love to play different sports. My favorite sport is soccer. I'm going to try out of the URI men's club team. If I don't make it
    however, I plan to create a intermeural team with my friends.
    I also enjoy playing volleyball. I used to play on the varsity team at North Kingstown Highschool. I don't know yet if I'll try 
    out for the team at URI because I want to play soccer but if soccer doesn't work out hopefully I'll make the volleyball team.</p><br>
