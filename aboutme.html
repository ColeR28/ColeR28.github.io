    <h1>About Cole</h1>
    <h2>College</h2>
    <p>My name is Cole and I'm currently taking CSC106 as the first class to fulfilling my Computer Science major.I have learnt
         some HTML and CSS before in Highschool so I hope that this class will help deepen my understanding aboutthe language 
        and help me get into the coding mindset for further classes. I have a lot of classes that I need to take to fulfillmy major so I 
        will most likely be taking courses over the J-term and the summer.
    </p>
    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>I love to play different sports. My favorite sport is soccer. I'm going to try out of the URI men's club team. If I don't make it 
    however, I plan to create a intermeural team with my friends.
    I also enjoy playing volleyball. I used to play on the varsity team at North Kingstown Highschool. I don't know yet if I'll try 
    out for the team at URI because I want to play soccer but if soccer doesn't work out hopefully I'll make the volleyball team.</p>
